                    </h2>
                    <p>Orther Mulelid-Tynes Technologies Inc. (OMTT) is a multinational development company with a focus on joint ventures with people who have great ideas. You provide the business idea and we provide the means to make the product.</p>
                    <p>
                        Between us we have over 25 years of development experience and we can take on all kinds of development projects. We generally look for businesses or people who have a small or non-existent development and/or IT operations department. We then work closely with you to bring the idea all the way from inception to finished product. Along the way we build a long term relationship keeping system operations running after the product goes to market and further develop the product as it needs to evolve.
